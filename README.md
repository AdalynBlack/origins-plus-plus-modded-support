## Origins++ Mod Compatibility Datapack

This datapack provides a compatibility layer between Origins++ and other mods to allow for modded items like food and armour to be added to the tags used by Origins++

To add support for a new mod either:
- Submit a pull request adding items from a mod into the relevant tags (fast)
- Sumbit a mod compatability request using the 'Issues' tab (slow)
