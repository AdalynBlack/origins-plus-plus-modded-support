## Origins++ Mod Compatibility Datapack

This datapack provides a compatibility layer between Origins++ and other mods to allow for modded items like food and armour to be added to the tags used by Origins++

To add support for a new mod either:
- Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-mod-compatibility/pulls) adding items from a mod into the relevant tags (fast response time)
- Submit a mod compatability request using the '[Issues](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-mod-compatibility/issues)' tab (slow response time)
