## Origins++ Mod Compatibility Datapack

This is a datapack which can be used with Origins++ to add compatability for modded items like food and armour.

To add a new mod either:
- Submit a pull request adding items from a mod into the relevant tags (quick)
- Sumbit a mod compatability request (slow)
