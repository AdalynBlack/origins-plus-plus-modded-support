## Origins++ Modded Support

- This repository holds tags with modded items so that compatibility with certain mods can come included in Origins++.
- This can also be built as a datapack to be able to add specific items to each tag for your playthrough.

To add support for a new mod either:
- Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support/pulls) adding items from a mod into the relevant tags (fast response time)
- Submit a mod compatability request using the '[Issues](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support/issues)' tab (slow response time)
